 * Verify a short-lived JWT access token and return its claims.

 * - **Production:** validates the RS256 signature against the issuer's JWKS
 *   (`<issuer>/.well-known/jwks.json`) and checks `iss`/`exp`. No per-request round
 *   trip — the JWKS is cached.
 * - **Dev mode** (`AUTH_DEV_MODE=true`): validates an HS256 token signed with
 *   `AUTH_DEV_SHARED_SECRET` — the same secret the `@auth/react` dev client mints with —
 *   so the whole flow works locally with no deployed server.
